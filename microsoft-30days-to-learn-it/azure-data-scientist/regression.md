## Regression
- Regression works by establishing a relationship between variables in the data that represent characteristics—known as the features—of the thing being observed, and the variable we're trying to predict—known as the label.
- To train the model, we start with a data sample containing the features, as well as known values for the label - so in this case we need historical data that includes dates, weather conditions, and the number of bicycle rentals.
- We'll then split this data sample into two subsets:
  - A training dataset to which we'll apply an algorithm that determines a function encapsulating the relationship between the feature values and the known label values.
  - A validation or test dataset that we can use to evaluate the model by using it to generate predictions for the label and comparing them to the actual known label values.
- The use of historic data with known label values to train a model makes regression an example of supervised machine learning.
